While on a yoga retreat in the foothills of Himalayas, my yoga teacher exclaimed, _“Find Your Balance”_, as everyone stood in the tree pose. Though I came out of the pose well, this statement got stuck in my mind and made me think how important it is to actually find your balance in every aspect of life.

The global COVID scenario has also made many of us to understand the importance of taking care of health, relationships, finances, which otherwise were taken for granted as life only seemed to go smooth.

As I read or listen to success stories, I learn that what distinguish leaders from others is the art of balancing. It’s a common view to see working adults burning out, working day in and out, ignoring their health, or personal lives, forgetting how short term gains can have long term costs. _“Excess of everything is bad”_ is a proverb that we hear since childhood and rightly so- be it work or rest, talk or silence, exercising or lethargy- equilibrium is everywhere important. People who maintain poise in most aspects of their life (if not all), are the ones who find themselves in harmony with respect to work, personal life and relationship with others.

While easy it may sound, finding balance is an art, it is a yogic practice, a skill that needs to be learnt, developed and practiced unless it becomes a natural habit.
