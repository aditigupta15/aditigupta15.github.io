Love is the most used and widely misinterpreted word. While every ticklish feeling cannot be described as 
love, words can’t even explain what real love feels like. I believe love is undefined in itself and is in 
fact amalgamation of respect, trust, care and understanding. 

There is a famous example of how Buddha differentiates between liking and love, “when you like a flower, 
you pluck it. But when you love a flower, you water it daily”. While this statement beautifully 
differentiates between the two emotions, love still remains unexplained. 

I believe love is respect. When you love someone, you honour the individual for who they are. You 
dignify their choices; there is faith and there is support. Love is not blind, it’s kind. Love is 
nurturing. When you water plants with care, they bloom. You don’t question a rose for being red in 
colour, you praise it’s shape, colour, aroma as it is. You prune a plant if need be for it’s healthy 
growth. This is how you love a person. You don’t accept their wrongs, but you accept the person in 
whole and learn and grow together. And this is done with fondness and joy. 

You can’t force affection, it’s comes naturally. More importantly, you can only pour in someone else’s cup 
only if your cup is full- meaning you can’t love someone if you don’t know what self love and self respect is. 
It’s impossible and it’s draining. The feeling of love is joyful but it’s not butterflies all the times, it’s 
full of experience. But above all #love is respect!#
