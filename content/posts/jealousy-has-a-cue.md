title: Jealousy has a cue

You would rarely know any individual who has not felt jealous ever in life. Its not an uncommon 
tendency for people to feel the dearth when they see others as complete or successful or abundant. 
But how they carry forth this feeling depends upon an individual’s mental capability. 

Based upon people’s reaction to jealousy triggers, I categorise people in 3 groups:

(i) *Perennial paucity* - such people are mostly dissatisfied no matter what all they have. 
Contentment is a polished skill unknown to this category. They constantly compare their 
circumstances with others and may feel deprived despite being abundant. This category falls 
on the lowest level of awareness. 

(ii) *Acceptability* - falling in the middle of the two categories, while these people might 
compare themselves with others, they do not fall trap of their emotions. They are mindful of 
their capabilities and realities and thus they make terms with what they have. Such people are 
content, if not happy.  Their enviousness is short-lived. 

(iii) *Transformability* -  these are the group of aware and wise. Although they rarely feel jealous, 
but when these people catch themselves feeling triggered by others’ success or abundance, they process 
the information and see it as an opportunity rather than getting into self- sabotage mode. 
This is the skill that I want to shed light upon. 

If someone carefully observes their feelings, then they can understand that it is not everyone or 
everything that makes them covet.  In fact it is something very specific. Hold on to that thought 
right away, think and reflect over it. With a hint of wisdom along with awareness,  one can understand 
that this trigger is your deeply embedded desire. While group two people will end up accepting the 
situation, group three work towards transformation. Once they acknowledge this emotion, and then with 
the right tools, subtle guidance and brilliant hard work, this “jealousy” can prove to be enlightening for them. 

Thus, understanding your own emotions and being aware of your own feelings is an integral part of learning and growing.
