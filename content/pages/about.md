Hello everyone,

I would like to introduce myself as Aditi Gupta, an academician, a writer and an experimenter.

Until present, I have meandered through the course of life and have thoroughly experimented en route.
I have lived through the mirage, being open to experiences and with utter faith in heart, I have learnt miracles.
I should have rather described myself as a perennial student though!!!

Befuddlement in me came with audacity that helped me to get clarity over a lot of things with deep insights.
This blog is a medium to share those truths that I personally discovered through subtle experiments.

While the ideas presented here are personal, I allow people to disagree with me.
Those who donâ€™t, enjoy the glimpses of my sight!

Happy Reading ðŸ˜Š

_PS. I am spilling the beans every Thursday_
