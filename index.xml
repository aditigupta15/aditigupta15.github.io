      <description>Being an academician, I would love to talk about a topic closest to my heart. Acquiring degrees, being able to read and write, does not make you educated! Well, I mean it.
I am sure you have seen this- a queue of professionals waiting for a metro during the busiest hours, get pushing into each other as soon as the metro arrives. Or a very smart graduate man breaking into a ruthless argument over streets.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
I would like to introduce myself as Aditi Gupta, an academician, a writer and an experimenter.
Until present, I have meandered through the course of life and have thoroughly experimented en route. I have lived through the mirage, being open to experiences and with utter faith in heart, I have learnt miracles. I should have rather described myself as a perennial student though!!!
Befuddlement in me came with audacity that helped me to get clarity over a lot of things with deep insights.</description>
