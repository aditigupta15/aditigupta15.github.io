        <p>Human brain is the most powerful machine that can ever exist. While the minds have potential to
transform electrons into energy, it comes with a natural tendency to play safe. Your brain makes you
defensive about your egos and thus makes it difficult for you to accept the unknown.
Thus, you can be intellectually doomed.</p>
<p><em>“Stay hungry, stay foolish”</em> said Steve Jobs at the Stanford commencement speech of 2005. He mentions how
following curiosity and intuition turned priceless for him and, I believe, so it can for each of us.
Of course being called a fool is not what we like, but let&rsquo;s not have internal battles here, rather
we got to live with the quest of learning. Being inquisitive as a child, questioning the obvious,
transforms cognition and can help you find ways at a place where you otherwise feel stuck. </p>
<p>Every living person has experiences, lessons and most importantly the perspectives that you might not have.
<em>‘Syadvad’</em>, the Jain doctrine of relative underpinning states that all proportions of truths are based on finite,
limited and contextual postulates. Since reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully.
So, by being open to learning from others, we let go off the safe boundaries that our mind otherwise creates which is a barrier to growth. </p>
<p>Growth is in fact a positive exponential function of learning. Life is too short to commit all the mistakes by yourself,
and instead we must know the art of assessment to pick from the life accounts of fellow beings. By being foolish,
you allow yourself to transcend. So, keep your horizon wide, intent right and pursuit of learning child-like.  </p>
<p> </p>
