      <description>Hello everyone,
I would like to introduce myself as Aditi Gupta, an academician, a writer and an experimenter.
Until present, I have meandered through the course of life and have thoroughly experimented en route. I have lived through the mirage, being open to experiences and with utter faith in heart, I have learnt miracles. I should have rather described myself as a perennial student though!!! Befuddlement in me came with audacity that helped me to get clarity over a lot of things with deep insights.</description>
