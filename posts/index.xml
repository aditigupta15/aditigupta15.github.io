      <title>Love is respect</title>

      <description>Love is the most used and widely misinterpreted word. While every ticklish feeling cannot be described as love, words can’t even explain what real love feels like. I believe love is undefined in itself and is in fact amalgamation of respect, trust, care and understanding.
There is a famous example of how Buddha differentiates between liking and love, “when you like a flower, you pluck it. But when you love a flower, you water it daily”.</description>

      <description>If one knows even the basics of driving, you know that you can&amp;rsquo;t always drive with first gear or with the fifth for that matter. You got to switch gears as per the need. So how can you drive your life always on emotions or always with the mind? Remember to shift as per demand of the situation. This is the crux of this age old debate. I am sure that everyone faces this battle between head and heart and especially the folks between the age of 20 and 40.</description>

      <title>Jealousy has a cue</title>

      <description>You would rarely know any individual who has not felt jealous ever in life. Its not an uncommon tendency for people to feel the dearth when they see others as complete or successful or abundant. But how they carry forth this feeling depends upon an individual’s mental capability. Based upon people’s reaction to jealousy triggers, I categorise people in 3 groups:
(i) Perennial paucity - such people are mostly dissatisfied no matter what all they have.</description>

      <description>Human brain is the most powerful machine that can ever exist. While the minds have potential to transform electrons into energy, it comes with a natural tendency to play safe. Your brain makes you defensive about your egos and thus makes it difficult for you to accept the unknown. Thus, you can be intellectually doomed.
“Stay hungry, stay foolish” said Steve Jobs at the Stanford commencement speech of 2005. He mentions how following curiosity and intuition turned priceless for him and, I believe, so it can for each of us.</description>

      <title>Literacy versus Education</title>

      <description>Being an academician, I would love to talk about a topic closest to my heart. Acquiring degrees, being able to read and write, does not make you educated! Well, I mean it.
I am sure you have seen this- a queue of professionals waiting for a metro during the busiest hours, get pushing into each other as soon as the metro arrives. Or a very smart graduate man breaking into a ruthless argument over streets.</description>
