      <p>Being an academician, I would love to talk about a topic closest to my heart.
Acquiring degrees, being able to read and write, does not make you educated!
Well, I mean it.</p>
<p>I am sure you have seen this- a queue of professionals waiting for a metro during the busiest hours,
get pushing into each other as soon as the metro arrives. Or a very smart graduate man
breaking into a ruthless argument over streets. Well, if you are thinking that it is about
etiquettes, attitude, behaviour, then yes you are right.
Lets look at the other extreme- I had a house help at my home for about 30 years, who has never even
been to a primary school, has taught me lessons for life- honesty, integrity, hard work. May be
she could not &ldquo;achieve&rdquo; a lot in terms of wealth or success as the world defines it, but
in my sight, she is a real human being.</p>
<p>The idea here I want to explain is that your textbooks don&rsquo;t edify you. Education has
more to do with morality, judgements, analysis and overall being. All the students
who study and graduate from a same class, taught by the same teacher, still comprehend
differently, and all of them are distinct individuals altogether. Institutional learning is
limited in its capacity and it&rsquo;s only the exposure to events or risks you take that teaches you
lessons worth holding for life. It makes you wise, moral and distinct.</p>
<p>Do not limit yourself to school training. Broaden your horizons, observe more, and learn from everyone and
everywhere, and lastly, do not fear experimenting. Cultivate morals and follow principles that make you <em>YOU</em> .</p>
