        <p>If one knows even the basics of driving, you know that you can&rsquo;t always drive with first gear or with the fifth for that matter.
You got to switch gears as per the need. So how can you drive your life always on emotions or always with the mind?
Remember to shift as per demand of the situation. This is the crux of this age old debate. I am sure that everyone faces
this battle between head and heart and especially the folks between the age of 20 and 40. While the world has been
struggling in this area since forever, I am no one to offer a sure solution. Rather I can just shed some light on how to
use your tools effectively. </p>
<p>To be able to know where to invest emotions or wit or both is a skill that not many are proficient in. Putting your brain
in relationships or something dear to heart, will only frustrate you. You cannot choose an ice cream flavour with calculations
nor you can be successful if you’re an emotional investor. Every individual sure has this basic clarity in their head when it
comes to small matters in life, but get stuck when it comes to matters that matter! This is where the tussle appears and makes
one stranded. So, why can&rsquo;t micro practices be applied to macro? Why can&rsquo;t we classify, even for difficult matters, the issues
that need intellect and the ones where you got to trust your feelings? Again, because it&rsquo;s not easy and it&rsquo;s a skill that
you develop with a regular drill. Wise are those who know between which gears to switch, where and when! </p>
<p>People who claim to be emotional, might be in despair if that is their perennial nature. Similarly, shrewd people cannot
be generally happy deep within. Then ultimately, it is about having a right approach and striking the right balance between the
two powerful organs that the nature has given to us. </p>
